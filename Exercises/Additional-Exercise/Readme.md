# 2. Two water jug problem
  * Consider an m litre jug and an n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty and there are no markings to measure smaller quantities.
    Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain v litres of water (v<n) in one of jug.

# 3. Escape Jail
 * A thief trying to escape from a jail. He has to cross N walls each with varying heights (every height is greater than 0). He climbs X feet every time. But, due to the slippery nature of those walls, every time he slips back by Y feet. Now the task is to calculate the total number of jumps required to cross all walls and escape from the jail.

# 4. Rain Water Trapping
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
 * Ex: For an array, a[]={2,0,2,1,3}. The total trapped water will be 3 units
