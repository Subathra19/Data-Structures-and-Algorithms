## 1. Egg Drop puzzle
* Consider n eggs and a building with k floors. Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a k-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing.
* We make a few assumptions:
  * An egg that survives a fall can be used again
  * A broken egg must be discarded.
  * The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
  * If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
  * If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall. 
* If only one egg is available then we have to drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second floor window. Continue upward until it breaks.
 In the worst case, this method may require k droppings. 
* Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the least number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?

## 2. Two water jug problem
  * Consider an m litre jug and an n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty and there are no markings to measure smaller quantities.
    Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain v litres of water (v<n) in one of jug.

## 3. Escape Jail
 * A thief trying to escape from a jail. He has to cross N walls each with varying heights (every height is greater than 0). He climbs X feet every time. But, due to the slippery nature of those walls, every time he slips back by Y feet. Now the task is to calculate the total number of jumps required to cross all walls and escape from the jail.

## 4. Rain Water Trapping
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
 * Ex: For an array, a[]={2,0,2,1,3}. The total trapped water will be 3 units

## 6. Stock-span problem
* The span of the stock’s price on a given day is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the given day.
