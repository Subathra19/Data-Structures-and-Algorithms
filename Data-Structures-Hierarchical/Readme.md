## [binarysearchtree.c](https://github.com/Subathra19/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Data-Structures-Hierarchical/binarysearchtree.c)
* This program is used to check whether the given tree is binary or not 
* A binary tree with following properties is known ad=s Binary Search Tree:
  * The left subtree of a node contains nodes with values lesser than the node’s value.
  * The right subtree of a node contains nodes with values greater than the node’s value.
  * The left and right subtree must also be a binary search tree.

## [deletenode.c](https://github.com/Subathra19/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Data-Structures-Hierarchical/deletenode.c)
* This program is used to delete the given node in a binary search tree
