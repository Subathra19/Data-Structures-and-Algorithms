# What is Dynamic programming?
It is an algorithmic technique to optimize the problem solved by recursion

# When to apply Dynamic programming?
It can be applied whenever the following conditions are met:
 * A problem can be divided into sub problems
 * A recursive solution is applied
 * If the solution has repetitive subproblems
* If above conditions are met then we can memoize the problem by using a look up array

# Time Complexity
  * [Fibonacci series with recursion](https://github.com/Subathra19/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Algorithms/Dynamic-Programming/fibrecusion.c): O(2^n)
  * [Fibonacci series after memoization](https://github.com/Subathra19/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Algorithms/Dynamic-Programming/fibmemoization.c): O(n)
